# calculator

In this project, I am going to be creating a basic calculator that will demonstrate my basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JS. The calculator design shows my ability to create elements in HTML and arrange them using flexbox. Moreover, the interactivity of the calculator displays my ability to use eventListeners, functions, and logic to solve a problem.

Personally, I surprised myself when writing the pseudocode for the logic of displaying the results of each button press and calculation necessary. Before getting into the project, I would have never imagined the logic to turn out this way. I am not sure if my implementation is the most efficient, but I found it to be quite a smart one.

I believe that the calculator can be made to look more pretty, and some additional functionality can be added (such as the ability to input decimal places). However, I feel like I have learned enough from this project so far, so onwards to the next one!
